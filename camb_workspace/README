This directory contains scripts and outputfiles for CMB temperature
power spectra. For both the "withisw" and "noisw" output files, we used
the same fid_params.ini file that was used to generate the P(k) used
in the other calculations for this project.

The difference between them is that, before running with the "noisw" tag,
we edited CAMB's equations.f90 so that ISW=0 for z=  1/a -1 <30.
